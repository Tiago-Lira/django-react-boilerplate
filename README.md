# django-react-boilerplate

A reaally simple structure to use django + react.

## Getting started

You'll need two shell sessions, one running the backend and the other one running webpack (frontend).

#### Getting the code!
```
> git clone git@github.com:Tiago-Lira/django-react-boilerplate.git
```

#### Running the backend

In the first terminal, install python requirements and run it!

```
> cd django-react-boilerplate/backend
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> python manage.py runserver

```

#### Running the frontend

In the second terminal, install js requirements and run it!
```
> cd django-react-boilerplate/frontend
> yarn install
> yarn run dev

```


Now you can access the project running on `localhost:8000/`.
